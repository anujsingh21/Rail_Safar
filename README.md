# Railway Inquiry System with Multilingual AI Chatbot

## Overview
This project enhances the railway inquiry experience by providing answers in any preferred language using an AI-powered chatbot. It integrates machine learning and natural language processing for real-time station announcements and multilingual support.

## Idea/Approach Details
- **Web Interface and Mobile Application:** Extends from a web interface to a mobile application, providing answers to user queries in preferred languages (Indian regional or foreign languages).
- **Multilingual Station Announcements:** Utilizes natural language processing to make station announcements in multiple languages.
- **Automatic Live Station Data Announcements:** Machine learning models announce live station data in various languages.
- **Multilingual AI Chatbot:** An AI-powered chatbot supports multilingual queries, allowing users to inquire about train schedules, PNR status, emergency alerts, etc., through text or voice inputs.
- **Noise Reduction in Speech Recognition:** Machine learning algorithms using frameworks like PyTorch reduce noise during speech recognition in noisy environments.
- **User Interface:** Users can access information about train schedules, routes, and PNR status directly through the user interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Django framework, Rest API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Speech Recognition:** Google speech-to-text & text-to-speech

## Dependencies
- **Voice Recognition:** Google speech-to-text & text-to-speech for generating speech in various languages.
- **Real-Time Data:** IRCTC API for real-time data, such as train schedules and platform changes.
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLP models like NLTK for processing language inputs.
- **Network Connectivity:** Requires network connectivity for real-time data access.
